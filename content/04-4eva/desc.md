4EVA is a collaboration with Pinar&Viola. The idea started after being commissioned by the Paradiso Phone Expo on creating a project around cellphones and the theme "Hey! How are you?" Thinking about how exaggeratedly perfect – surpassing stepfordian levels – are the virtual girlfriends and boyfriends one can usually find on the internet, we created a message service that delivers intimate pictures and texts from a perfect lover. More specifically, we wanted to create  narrative of a virtual relationship that would develop in a crescendo of passion and obsession that would burst in flames in its grand finale. 

I was in charge both of the technical side and writing the text messages that were to be delivered to one’s cellphone or e-mail account. The writing process was mainly scouring social media for exchanged love messages, which were then editorialised and recombined.
