# I will

I am intrigued by the effects of small actions on the future. Small, seemingly insignificant gestures might have amazingly huge and unpredictable effects on our lives. I decided to explore that moment just after the now that implicitly determines with which choices we are going to be faced in the future. 

I will is a project that deals with metaphors of how our thoughts influence our actions and, consequently, influence our future. It does that by monitoring Twitter for people saying things they intend to do in the future and, through the means of databending techniques, adding to the user’s image what he or she said. 

It is a continuous timeline of images with their owner’s tweets embedded in their code. Those images, all created through a php script that monitors Twitter for instances of the string “I Will”, are to serve as metaphors of how the smallest of actions can have an astounding effect on ourselves. They are the unpredictable result of one’s actions over oneself.
