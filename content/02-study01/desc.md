# Study 01

url: https://guimachiavelli.github.io/01/

Study 01 is an interactive narrative, a first approach at building an internally and conceptually coherent interactive narrative world and an exploration of the clash of formal and vulgar languages. The story takes the user through the journey of a man who seeks to begin a homosexual revolution based on highly sexualised interpretations of anarchist ideals. 

As the first full-blown and finished study I made, it offered a rewarding process of trial and error unfettered by any specific goal, only the interest in learning more about anarchism and in the imagining of a radical gay utopia. 

The writing process was copying, pasting and editorialising two main sources: anarchist texts and gay sex ads/profiles. Both sources are hugely radical and explicit, both passionate about their subject and deeply poetic in their earnestness. The chosen medium instead, the interactive narrative, is simplification of Interactive Fiction stories.
