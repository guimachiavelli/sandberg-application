# study 01 card

Study 01 is an interactive nonsense narrative that takes the user through the journey of a man who seeks like-minded fellows  to begin a homossexual revolution based on highly sexualised interpretations of anarchist ideals. 

It was conceptualised as a first approach at building an internally and conceptually coherent interactive narrative world and an exploration of the clash of formal language with the vulgar.

The narrative itself was written using two main sources: anarchist texts and gay sex ads/profiles. The interface instead was designed and built prioritising standard APIs and design elements.
