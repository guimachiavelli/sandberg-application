Thinking about how exaggeratedly perfect – surpassing stepfordian[1] levels – are the virtual girlfriends and boyfriends one can usually find on the internet, Pinar&Viola and I created a message service that delivers intimate pictures and texts from a perfect lover. 

My personal interest in this project was the narrative of a virtual relationship that would develop in a crescendo of passion and obsession, until it eventually would burst out in flames in its grand finale. Mixing the allure of a perfect lover, the logical impossibility of such a thing, our craving for services that cater to every single desire and the implicit fear around all digital contacts, I saw it as a virtual tragedy[2], narrated with the actual messages from real lovers in their different states of infatuation and bitterness.

I was in charge both of the technical side and writing the text messages that were to be delivered to one’s cellphone or e-mail account. The writing process was mainly scouring social media for exchanged love messages, which were then editorialised and recombined.

4EVA was a collaboration with Pinar&Viola and one their capsule collections. Initially released as part of phone-expo.nl and using SMSs, it is now also available on the project url.

footnote: 2. Tragedy is greek people on a stage faking emotion and weeping buckets. The practice started with the creation of competitive literary festivals in Athens. The winner would win a free goat (tragōidia in Greek) - hence ‘tragedy’.
