# The Smoking Room

url: https://thesmokingroom.net

The Smoking Room was created with Pinar&Viola for the “This is the ENDD: The E-Cigarette in Context”, a conference organised by Rhizome at the New Museum to discuss the political and social impact of e-cigarettes. 

On Pinar&Viola’s words, the goal was “to create a virtual room which would be the perfect justification to take a relaxing cigarette break without harming your health” as well as a “new space where one can meet strangers.”

I was responsible for handling the technical aspects, both server- and client-side. Besides the subject matter, my main interests were to get acquainted with varied areas, from fluid dynamics (for the smoke generation), face recognition (to add the cigarette to the avatar’s mouth) and real-time chat.

Though the room is admittedly empty since the end of the conference, it is still accessible and fully functional at the project site using the latest versions of Opera, Chrome and Firefox.
