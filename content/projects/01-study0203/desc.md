# Studies 02 and 03

I’m currently dividing my time between two studies. The first focuses on poetry and generative processes of uncreative writing, whilst the second is still in its infancy and is interested in recursion as a concept applied to neurotic behaviour.

==============================================

## Study 02, codenamed poet, 
came from the idea of trying to assemble short poems using verses from written poems as an exercise of automated uncreative writing. 

The idea grew to become a site where each user would customise their own poet and rate each poem, at which point it started to lose focus. I tracked back on all grandiose ideas to have a very simple “click a button for a poem”. 

I’m currently improving the algorithm that assembles the verses, which is oftentimes an iterative process with frequent dead ends, as the following examples in different variations of this algorithm might demonstrate.

quote: To lodge beneath my scarlet tunic’s fold? / And if it rains, a closed car at four. / Interior of the cavern, side by side / And from the turf a fountain broke / A ronnynge pryze onn seyncte daie to ordayne, / And let that pine to aggravate thy store; / To early coffee-stands.
first rudimentary assembler, without any rules or commands did not really work. I was expecting that things would connect a bit more, that the verses by themselves would be connected by the reader’s mind because of simple juxtaposition.

quote: I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker, / Till, weary of their wiles, ourselves we ease;
first rudimentary assembler

quote: Of infant slain by doom perverse. / Yet, are we not for one brief day, / And—“Are we then so serious?” / But we will downward with the Tweed, / (Unwillingly we broke our master’s chain), / Was the road of late so toilsome? did we stop discouraged nodding / “What shall we ever do?” / I doubt, but let us call, that we may learn.
limiting the amount of personal pronouns seems to have had a positive effect on the overall cohesion

quote: And danced all the modern dances; / Deplored with tears her long-regretted Lord / And reaching fingers, ‘mid a luscious heap / Nothing again nothing. 
avoid starting a verse with the same type of word that ended the previous verse, in order to avoid two prepositions and other awkward structures

==============================================

## Study 03, codenamed want,

url: https://guimachiavelli.github.io/03/

Started out as an exercise mixing the simple game http://robotfindskitten.org/, where the user plays a blind robot that wants to find a kitten in a room full of objects, and the idea of recursion, i.e., a process that calls itself when it ends, creating a potentially infinite loop.

The idea of someone who keeps wanting things, losing interest in something as soon as that something is at hand, strikes an obvious comparison with most people’s lives, be it in the endless acquisition of useless and shiny superfluous things, be it in the natural process of growth and learning.

The study is currently at a crossroads of sorts, trying to determine what is the angle from which I want to continue approaching it, whilst keeping it as simple and close to the initial concept as possible.

A very early prototype is available at the project url. Use arrows to navigate yourself (marked with an @) in a world where only objects and empty space exist.
