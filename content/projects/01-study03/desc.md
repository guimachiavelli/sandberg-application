# Study 03 – Ongoing

url: https://guimachiavelli.github.io/03/

This study is in progress and, thus, unfinished. I have decided to show it as a snapshot of my usual process when approaching a new project.

Study 03 started out as an exercise mixing the simple game http://robotfindskitten.org/, where the user plays a blind robot that wants to find a kitten[1] in a room full of objects, and the idea of recursion[2], i.e., a process that calls itself when it ends, creating a potentially infinite loop.

The idea of someone who keeps wanting things, losing interest in something as soon as that something is at hand, strikes an obvious comparison with most people’s lives, be it in the endless acquisition of useless and shiny superfluous things, be it in the natural process of growth and learning.

In its current state, the study is an almost childish and biased simplification of life under modern capitalism. The current path is clearly not going to work without a few diversions. How can it be made more interesting? Perhaps it should veer off into psychology to see if obsessive behaviour can be defined as a recursive behaviour?

A very early prototype is available at the project url. Use arrows to navigate yourself (marked with an @) in a world where only objects and empty space exist.
