=====

I am a brazilian-italian developer, currently based in London and working for British design studio Applied Works, where I mainly focus in developing web application interfaces and data visualisations. 

Prior to that, I have been a freelance developer/designer in Italy working for varied clients, from an Italian IT company to Dutch startups to Brazilian businesses, whilst collaborating with  designers, programmers and journalists.

In 2012, as part of my education at Hyper Island, I worked as an intern at dutch/turkish design studio Pinar&Viola, taking crucial roles on most technical matters.

In the same year I finished the Digital Media Program at Swedish digital media school Hyper Island and before that, in 2009, I attained my BA in Communication/Journalism in Brazil.
