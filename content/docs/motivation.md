I find myself in a grey area between research, writing and programming. I am interested in the use of code as a path to understand subjects and to explore ideas that do not carry any exchange value, that cannot be monetised, fragile things that barely make sense. I seek to establish a practice through dialoguing with the machine, instead of merely using it.

My research interests go from the cesspit of profanity that is 4chan’s /b/ and the cotton candy world of imgur to the ideology critique of Slavoj Žižek and the melancholy science of Theodor Adorno. As far as I am concerned, they are all equally valid, they all collectively shape contemporary society in their own way and function as reputable sources of reflection of and on our lives.

To explore those ideas, mediums and corpora, I seek an environment that is open to the frailty of processes whilst being profoundly strict in its criticism of those same processes and their results. A fertile ground for discussion that contemplates the fact that everything, that nothing is ever truly finished and that every idea is fluid and might melt and self-destruct at a moments notice. I believe the Sandberg Institute might be a place that facilitates that.

On the technical side, I am proficient in a few different programming, with a special focus on the web. I have worked the past 4 years mainly as a programmer and use the skills I acquired as the fundamental tool for every project. To that I add my background as a journalist and the soft skills the activity entails, such as editing, writing and researching.
